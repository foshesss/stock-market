# Fake Stock Market
I've been recently fascinated with the stock market-- live trades, seeing money move, and watching the market react to real world news. While I would love to pretend I have unlimited money and dump everything into the stock market, that is not the reality I live in. This project has 2 goals for me:
1. Make a little web-based game out of the stock market-- allowing me to buy, sell, and set limit orders.
2. Try to recreate Robinhood's website.

This project is also my first time using Svelte. I saw a Twitch streamer using it and it looked too fun to not try out.

## Steps to Start
You can build this project yourself with the following command:
```bash
npm run dev -- --open
```

## Goal implementation
- Recreate Robinhood's home page, which has the line graph and all of your assets on the side.
- Use perlin noise to mimic real life stock movement.
- Clicking on stocks will update the graph on the home page to show stats of that current stock.

## Reach goals
- Fake events that will sway certain types of companies (ie: MASSIVE SOLAR FLARE HITS EARTH, NVDA BANKRUPT)
- Game over for going bankrupt, start over screen.
